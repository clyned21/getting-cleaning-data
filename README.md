# getting-cleaning-data

My project contains 3 files as required for this project.

1. This file (readme.md) describes the other two files and the input files used

2. The run_analysis.R file is heavily documented and outlines all the steps that I took to process 
the data and execute all the required steps

3. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data 
CodeBok.md contains:
- All the original metadata from the features_info file
- Activity labels from activity_labels
- descriptions of the columns added to the original datasets
- summary of the processing steps applied to the data

The files I processed in this project are:

*- 'features.txt': List of all features.

*- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

*- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

*- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

*- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

*- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

*- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the training activity for each window sample. 

*- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the test activity for each window sample.
